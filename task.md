#  ðŸ“” Learning Diary
<p> The Entry to tech bootcamp has been really helpful in understanding tech.
The prerequisite <img src=https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Java-Emblem.jpg width="20" height="20"> Java course on Codecademy did a good job introducing me to Java and also covered the major concepts like Classes, methods, Arrays and Inheritance. </p>
<ul>
<li><p> The <b>first</b> topic covered in the bootcamp was on how to use the Terminal (<i>MAC</i>) or CommandPrompt (<i>Windows</i>). I learned how to move through directories, create new files, and directories, and also the common commands that are used on the terminal. </p> </li>

<li><p> The <b>second</b> topic covered was <img src=https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Icon-1788C.png width="12" height="12"> Git and <img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Octicons-mark-github.svg/2048px-Octicons-mark-github.svg.png width="12" height="12"> Github. I learned what git does, the importance of version control, and how to use it on the terminal. I also learned how to connect GitHub (Remote repository) to my system (<i>Local Repository</i>), how to push, pull, fetch, and merge, and also the importance of branches when experimenting with the code. </p>
<p>ðŸš© So far, the commands used to synchronise the local repo and the remote repo are a bit confusing. I plan to research and also ask my technical mentor questions about this.</p>
<p>ðŸŸ¢ I practiced using the commands and they were much clearer. <span>Also, in my next meeting with my technical mentor, I'll ask for guidance.</span> </p> </li>

<li><p> The <b>third</b> topic covered was on the <b>S</b>oftware <b>D</b>evelopment <b>L</b>ife <b>C</b>ycle (<i><b>SDLC</b></i>). I learned about the various phases software project go through before they become a reality. <p>There are six phases: </p></p> 
<ol>
<li> <b>Analysis</b></li>
<li> <b>Planning</b></li>
<li> <b>Design</b></li>
<li> <b>Implementation</b></li>
<li> <b>Testing and Integration</b></li>
<li> <b> Maintenance</b></li>
</ol>


<p>I also learned about SDLC methodologies like waterfall and agile. I learned about agile frameworks like SCRUM, Kanban, and XP. </p>
<p>ðŸš© So far, the only confusing part is how tickets are defined and how much specification is needed. I'll do a bit more research on it.</p> </li>
</ul>
