#  ðŸ“” Learning Diary
<p> The Entry to tech bootcamp has been really helpful in understanding tech.
The prerequisite <img src=https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Java-Emblem.jpg width="20" height="20"> Java course on Codecademy did a good job introducing me to Java and also covered the major concepts like Classes, methods, Arrays and Inheritance. </p>
<p> The first topic covered in the bootcamp was on how to use the Terminal (<i>MAC</i>) or CommandPrompt (<i>Windows</i>). I learnt how to move through directories, create new files and directories and also the common commands that are used on the terminal. </p>

<p> The second topic covered was <img src=https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Icon-1788C.png width="12" height="12"> Git and <img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Octicons-mark-github.svg/2048px-Octicons-mark-github.svg.png width="12" height="12"> Github. I learnt what git does, the importance of version control and how to use it on the terminal. I also learnt how to connect github (Remote repository) to my system (Local Repository), how to push, pull, fetch and merge and also the importance of branches when experimenting with the code. </p>
<p> So far, the commands used to synchronise the local repo and the remote repo are a bit confusing. I plan to research and also ask my technical mentor questions about this.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to the next topic and excited about learning new topics.</p>
